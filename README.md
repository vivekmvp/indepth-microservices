# Microservice practice Template code

**This source code is practice template code which I will be using in to implement training modules on Microservices.**

I will be going through series of **training modules on Microservices available at** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-microservices-with-dotnet/

This source-code is inspired from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-dotnet-kubernetes

I will be using this code as a template and will fork the branch out of it to implement series of trainings available at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/create-microservices-with-dotnet/
